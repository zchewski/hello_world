Did you ever hear the tradgedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
I thought not.
Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the sith, so great and so powerful that he could even stop others from dying.
You mean he could save them from death?
Yes.  Unfortunatly he became so powerful that the only thing he feared was losing his power--which of course he did.
See, he had taught his apprentice everything he knew and his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
Ironic.
He could save others from death, but not himself.
Is there a way to learn this power?
Not from a jedi.
